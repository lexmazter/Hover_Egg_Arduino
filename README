Hover Egg Arduino - 2014

This project is developed in Visual Studio 2013 with 
Visual Micro Plugin on Arduino Duemilanove.

This project consists in a "Hovering" "Egg" inside a plastic pipe, 
using an Arduino Duemilanove Controller and a custom driver to drive
the fan and make the Egg Hover.

A second project will follow that will connect with this one in order
to control the Arduino from an Android app via Bluetooth.

More details soon...
